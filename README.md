Welcome to HandyGUI. This is a simple GUI based plugin used to give players useful information about your server.
commands:
/media
/rules

I reccomend you use smalls caps text (https://mcutils.com/small-text-converter) to keep the GUI looking smooth. MV is there for you to replace with your own servers abreviated name (MV = ModdernVanilla).
